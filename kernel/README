USB Redirection Kernel Module

This module allows a Linux system to instatiate USB devices
that are located on a remote device.  The USB data is transferred
over a socket using the USBREDIR protocol, which is generally
used in conjunction with the SPICE project.

You will need the USBREDIR user space tools.  They can
be found at http://www.spice-space.org/page/UsbRedir.

To use, start the usbredirserver on a remote system.
For example,
 ./usbredirserver --port 4000 125f:db8a
will export my ADATA thumb drive on the remote system.

Next, on the local system, build and insert the usbredir
kernel module:
  make && sudo modprobe ./usbredir.ko

Finally, on the local system, connect a socket and relay that to
the kernel module.  The connectkernel utility will do this as follows:
  ./connectkernel adata4000 my.remote.device.com 4000

The device should attach and be usable on the local system.
